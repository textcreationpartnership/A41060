         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF thou ſeriouſly conſider that we are fallen into the last days and ages of the World, in which the Lord of Heaven and Earth will come and plead with his Enemies, and to recompence them according to their works, <hi>Rev. 20.12. 2 Cor. 5.10. Mat. 16.27.</hi> and that the terrible day of the Lord is coming with burns as an Oven, and all his Enemies are before him as ſtubble, and he will call all men high and low, rich and poor to an account for their deeds done, and reward every one according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be bad: The ſerious conſideration of theſe things ſhould put thee to a ſtand, to ſearch and to ſee how it ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the Lord. And if thou deſires the knowledge of the living God and of his eternal Truth, and deſires to know the dealings of the Lord with his people, and his ſeed here upon the earth, ſince he made man and created him, and gave him a being upon the earth, look into this following Extract which is taken out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and thou mayſt thereby ſee how the Lord hath led his ſeed and people from the beginning of
<pb facs="tcp:52673:3"/>the World until this preſent day: As alſo his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care and love that he hath exerciſed unto them all along as thou thy ſelf will judge in the reading of this Treatiſe through, which will be for thy own advantage, and the building of thee up in the knowledge of the Lord and his Truth, and alſo in the knowledge of the Scriptures, which too many are and have been ignorant of, and therefore have they dyed in their ſins, according as Chriſt ſaith, if you do not believe that I am he ye ſhall dye in your ſins, <hi>Joh. 8.24.</hi> And none do believe that Jeſus is Chriſt, but who believes in his light and in his holy Spirit; for that is the unction of the holy one, the anointing which is the Chriſt, which is the truth and is no lie, and which leads into all truth, which Chriſt Jeſus promiſed he would ſend when he went to his Father, in <hi>John 16.</hi> It is expedient for you, ſaith he, that I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart I will ſend him unto you: howbeit when the Spirit of truth is come he ſhall guide you into all truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but he ſhall receive of mine and ſhew it unto you; all things that the Father hath are mine, therefore I ſaid unto you he ſhall take of
<pb facs="tcp:52673:3"/>mine and ſhew it unto you; thou mayſt read of this at large in this Chapter: So this is the very life of our knowledge of the truth to mind the light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt which is in thy heart, and his Spirit that he hath put in thy inward parts, and with that eye read this following Treatiſe in ſobriety, gentleneſs, and meekneſs of Spirit, without partiality or prejudice, and thereby thou mayſt gain knowledge and underſtanding into the truth of God, and alſo into the Scriptures which it may be thou didſt not know before. Thou mayſt alſo read in this following Book of the Redemption and bringing back of the Captivity of the Church of Chriſt, whoſe day of redemption and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance comes as is ſhewed therein by the Scriptures: and ſo as I ſaid before being the time is ſhort, and the Lord cometh as a thief in the night, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Geneſis.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, the ſame was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with God, all things were made by him and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him was not any thing made that was made. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. This is the teſtimony and the record of <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple that leaned on Jeſus breaſt, this agreeing with the firſt of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was void, and without form, and darkneſs was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, and God ſaid let there be light and there was light. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. So here is the record which is in heaven, God, the Spirit, and the Word that was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with God, by which all things were made and created, the Heavens and the Earth, the Sea and the firmament, and all things that are therein, and every living creature that moveth in the Sea, and upon the Earth were created by the word of God, and God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good; and God ſaid let us make man in our own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and let them have dominion; ſo God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them.</p>
               <p>To this agrees <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.4. where Chriſt ſaith, have you not read, he that made them in the beginning made them male and female? <hi>fe</hi> added to <hi>male</hi> ſignifieth to encreaſe, to multiply or bring forth. So here is all the diſtinction that the word that was in the beginning made between them, God called them male and female: the ſame <hi>John</hi> as bears witneſs of the word that was in the beginning with God, alſo bears witneſs that the word was made fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is Chriſt in the male and female, this is the true
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52673:5"/>image of God full of grace and truth, according as the Apoſtle ſaith in the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. And that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs; and this word ſtood in the decree and election of God, until it was made fleſh, his Son manifeſted in the fleſh, which makes and creates the image of God in the male and in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, in righteouſneſs and true holineſs in the male and female; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. The males were to be the Lords, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.13.15.16. <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.3. They were to offer a male without blemiſh, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. they were curſed that had a male in their flock and offered unto the Lord a corrupt thing: and again <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2. and <hi>Numbers</hi> 18.15. According to this Law of <hi>Moſes Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> obſerved the command of God, and circumciſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> on the eight day, as it is written in the Law of the Lord, every male that openeth the womb ſhall be called holy to the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.21.23. here is the true and living image which God has created in the male and female; but here lies the myſtery, God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh, which is yet hid to the moſt of men, that lies in the fall, but perfectly known to thoſe that are in the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and redemption. Howbeit on the ſixth day the Lord form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man of the duſt of the ground and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life, and the man became a living Soul. And the Lord God planted a Garden Eaſtward in <hi>Eden,</hi> and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> to dreſs it and to keep it <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and the Lord God ſaid it is not good for man to be alone, I will make him an help meet for him; and the Lord God cauſed a deep ſleep to fall upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and he ſlept, and he took one of his ribs and cloſed up the fleſh thereof, and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman, and brought her unto the man; and <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid this is now bone of my bone and fleſh of my fleſh ſhe ſhall be called woman, becauſe ſhe was taken out of man. So <hi>Adam</hi> gave names to all the creatures, for God brought every beaſt of the field, and every fowl of the air unto <hi>Adam,</hi> that he might give names unto them, and ſo he brought the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and he called her woman, becauſe ſhe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of man.</p>

               <p>Now the Serpent being more ſubtle than any beaſt of the field which God had made, he began to exerciſe his ſubtlety, and to lay his temptations and ſnares unto the innocent and weak, and ſo began with the woman which was but a part of man; and in the firſt place told her a lie to entice her to break the command of the Lord God, which the Lord God ſtrictly commanded the man that he ſhould not eat of it, for in the day that thou eats thou ſhalt ſurely die ſaith the Lord: ſaith the Serpent, hath the Lord God ſaid that ye may not eat of every tree in the Garden? the woman ſaid unto the Serpent, we may eat of the trees of the Garden, but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midſt of the Garden, God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat, neither ſhall ye touch it leſt ye die; the Serpent ſaid, ye ſhall not ſurely die. Here was the lyar, and ſo Chriſt ſaith of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. ye are of the Father the Devil, and the luſt of your Father ye will do, he was a Murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no truth in him, when he ſpeaketh a lie he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of his own, for he is a lyar and the Father of it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. he that committeth ſin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinned from the beginning; ſo this was he that did encounter with weak and innocent woman, and when he led out her eyes to look upon the tree, ſhe ſaw it was good and pleaſant to the eye, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, and ſhe took of the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to eat, and gave alſo unto her Husband and he did eat with her: And ſo here they both came into the diſobedience and fell from the command of God, lending their ears, their minds, and their eyes to the temptation of the Devil, fell from righteouſneſs, fell from innocency and holineſs, and ſo became tranſgreſſors againſt God and breakers of his commands. And ſo the Devil was the Original and beginning of this ſin and tranſgreſſion, and they hearkening unto his temptation, and anſwering unto his deſires, and joining with him in it, came under the curſe and ſo was driven out from the preſence of God, and ſo dread and fear took hold on them, that when they heard the voice of God they hid themſelves from his preſence among the trees of the Garden, and when the Lord called unto <hi>Adam,</hi> he heard his voice and was afraid
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52673:6"/>becauſe he was naked; the Lord ſaid, who told thee thou waſt naked? haſt thou eaten of the tree whereof I told thee thou ſhouldſt not eat? the man ſaid, the woman thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And the Lord ſaid unto the woman, what is this that thou haſt done? and the woman ſaid the Serpent beguiled me and I did eat: and the Lord ſaid unto the Serpent becauſe thou haſt done this, thou art curſed above all cattel, and above every beaſt of the field, upon thy belly ſhalt thou go, and duſt ſhalt thou eat all the days of thy life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p>This is the Serpents portion, and the decree of God upon him for evermore, and all that are of his Spirit, that hearken to his temptations, who diſobey the command of the living <hi>God,</hi> and tranſgreſs againſt him, he that commits ſin is of the Devil 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. And the Lord ſaid I will put enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and between thy ſeed and her ſeed, it ſhall bruiſe thy head, (mark, that the womans ſeed ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head, the Lord hath ſaid it) and thou ſhall bruiſe his heel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and this hath been and is fulfilled, the heel of the precious ſeed hath been bruiſed ever ſince the day that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, the Lamb hath been flain from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8.</p>
               <p>The deſcending part of the Lamb hath been bruiſed and ſlain ſince the world had a foundation in the heart of man, for the Devil got into <hi>Evahs</hi> heart, and <hi>Adams</hi> heart by his temptation, when they obeyed the voice of the Serpent (and diſobeyed his voice that made them) he told them they ſhould be as Gods, but he became the God of that world of ſin and of tranſgreſſion; and this world is ſet in the hearts of all men in the fall, that they cannot find the beginning or the end of the work of God, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.11. And the God of this world hath blinded the minds of all them which believe not 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. through the diſobedience that did enter into their hearts: and ſo their fooliſh hearts were darkened, and he, the Prince of darkneſs, hath ruled ever ſince this world had a foundation in the heart of man, and to this very day doth rule in the children of diſobedience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 6. And ſo that precious part of the Lamb, that deſcending part that God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52673:6"/>hath placed in mans heart, hath been and is ſlain in all the children of diſobedience, who are not riſen with Chriſt unto righteouſneſs and true holineſs. Now he that aſcended, ſaith the Apoſtle, is the ſame that deſcended firſt into the nethermoſt parts of the earth (and he that deſcended is the ſame alſo that aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far above all heavens, that he might ſill all things, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8.9.) So there hath he ſuffered and been oppreſſed as a Cart hath been with ſheaves, and born the iniquities of all above 5600 years. But the Lord of his infinite mercy and love reſerved a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and redemption at that very inſtant, who decreed and ſaid that the precious ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head and break his power: And ſo as it is already manifeſted and fulfilled; the Word which the Lord ſpake that he ſhould bruiſe his heel; ſo, as certainly and aſſuredly as the word of the Lord endureth for ever, and that not one jot or tittle of it ſhall fail till all be fulfill'd; ſo certainly will he fulfill this part alſo that the ſeed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head and break his power; and to this purpoſe hath he redoubled his promiſe again and again as we ſhall ſhew more fully hereafter: And ſo <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſtood under the ſentence that the Lord pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; unto woman that he would greatly multiply her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in her conception, and in bringing forth Children: And unto <hi>Adam</hi> he ſaid curſed is the ground for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all thy days; ſo in this miſerable ſtate they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and in this darkneſs, tranſgreſſion, and diſobedience. <hi>Adam</hi> knew his Wife and ſhe brought forth a Son; and called his name <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> called his wife <hi>Eve,</hi> becauſe ſhe was the mother of all living: and this <hi>Cain</hi> was the fruits of the Spirit of the Devil who was a lyar and a murderer. And again ſhe bare his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> was a tiller of the ground, but <hi>Abel</hi> was a keeper of Sheep; and in proceſs of time it came to paſs, that <hi>Cain</hi> brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord, and <hi>Abel</hi> he alſo brought of the firſtlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof, and the Lord had reſpect unto <hi>Abel</hi> and his offering (for the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. by faith <hi>Abel</hi> offered unto God) but unto <hi>Cain</hi> and his offering he had no reſpect:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52673:7"/>And <hi>Cain</hi> was wroth, and his countenance fell; and the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Cain,</hi> why art thou wroth? and why is thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance fallen? if thou doſt well ſhalt thou not be accepted? if thou doſt not well ſin lyeth at thy door; And unto thee ſhall be his deſire, and thou ſhalt rule over him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Abel</hi> offered a more excellent offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than <hi>Cain,</hi> by which he obtained a witneſs that he was righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, God teſtifying of his guifts, and by faith he being dead yet his bloud ſpeaketh; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. and alſo <hi>Cain</hi> manifeſted what ſeed he ſprang from, unto which God ſaid, I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed, which ſeed was a lyar and a murderer from the beginning: and <hi>Cain</hi> talked with his brother, and it came to paſs that when they were in the field, that <hi>Cain</hi> roſe up againſt <hi>Abel</hi> his brother and ſlew him: and wherefore ſlew he him? becauſe his own works were evil and his brothers righteous 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. And this <hi>Cains</hi> Spirit hath remained amongſt men to this very day, for he ſlew his brother about offering unto God, and the worſhip of God; and ſo this <hi>Cains</hi> ſpirit hath been ſlaying, and killing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting ever ſince, (about Offerings, and Sacrifices, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips) righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> and that ſpirit which God accepts hath been perſecuted and ſlain, and is to this day. But God will fulfill the words of Chriſt upon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.35. that upon you might come all the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth, from the blood of rightous <hi>Abel:</hi> but the Lord knew when <hi>Abel</hi> was ſlain, and he knows, and ſees, and hath ſeen all the righteous blood that hath been ſhed ſince <hi>Abel:</hi> and the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Cain,</hi> what haſt thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood hath cryed to me from the ground, and now thou art curſed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brothets blood from thy hand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10, 11. And under this curſe all <hi>Cains</hi> ſpirit and off ſpring remains, a fugitive and vagabond from the Lord; for <hi>Cain</hi> went out from the preſence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of <hi>Nod. ver.</hi> 16. And <hi>Adam</hi> knew <hi>Eve</hi> his Wife again, and ſhe bare a Son and called his name <hi>Seth,</hi> for God (ſaith ſhe) hath appointed me another Son inſtead of <hi>Ahel</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew: So
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52673:7"/>here is another Son brought forth of <hi>Abel</hi>'s ſeed which the Lord accepted, and to which the promiſe of the Lord remained: and to <hi>Seth,</hi> to him alſo there was born a Son, and he called his name <hi>Enos,</hi> then began men to call upon the name of the Lord: here was the right ſeed again, which ſet up the worſhip of God, as you may read in the fifth of <hi>Geneſis</hi> the Generations of them that worſhipped God in that day from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſome of which the Apoſtle bore witneſs of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5.</p>

               <p>And <hi>Lamech</hi> lived 182 years and begat a Son, and he called his name <hi>Noah,</hi> ſaying, this ſhall conmfort us concerning the work and toil of our hands, becauſe of the ground which the Lord hath curſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.28.</p>

               <p>And ſo here again, the earth was corrupted, and here they fell again into tranſgreſſion, and the Lords Spirit was grieved, and the Lord ſaid my Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man for that he is but fleſh, yet his daies ſhall be 120 years, and God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was evil, and that

But <hi>Noah</hi> found grace in the eyes of the Lord, <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt man and perfect in his Generation, and <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God, and the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence; and God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all fleſh had corrupted his way: and God ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Noah,</hi> the end of all fleſh is come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them, and behold I will deſtroy them with the earth, make the an Ark of <hi>Gopher</hi> wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Noah</hi> being a perfect and juſt man obeyed the Lord, and ſet about the work, for he had the Lords words and promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.18. with thee I will eſtabliſh my Covenant, and thou ſhalt come into the Ark, thou and thy Sons and thy Wife, and thy Sons Wives with thee: So <hi>Noah</hi> laboured in the work and Commandment of the Lord, and preached amongſt them, after the Lord complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the wickedneſs of men, a hundred years before the flood; in which time the long ſuffering of God waited while the Ark was preparing, ſo that there was but eight perſons ſaved 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. And <hi>Noah</hi> took of every living thing of all fleſh, two of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort, and brought into the Ark to him, to keep them alive, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Lord commanded him, male and female of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort, and of the fowls after their ſort, and the cattel after their kind, and of every creeping thing after his kind, two ſhall come unto thee of every ſort to keep them alive, and take unto thee of all food that is eaten, and it ſhall be meat for thee and them, thus did <hi>Noah</hi> according to all that God commanded him.</p>
               <p>The Lord God ſaid unto <hi>Noah,</hi> come thou and all thy houſe into the Ark, for thee have I ſeen righteous in this Generation, and of every clean beaſt take with thee by ſevens, males, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, for yet ſeven days and I will cauſe it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living ſubſtance that I have made, will I deſtroy from the face of the earth.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52673:9"/>enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed; and ſo upon this ſeed and world of ungodly men the Lord brought the flood, and overflowed the whole world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their wickedneſs, ſo that all fleſh dyed, and every living ſubſtance was deſtroyed, <hi>Noah</hi> only remained alive and they that were with him in the Ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth 150 days, and in the ſecond Month, on the 27. day of the month the earth was dryed, and God ſpake unto <hi>Noah</hi> ſaying, Go forth of the Ark thou and thy Wife, and thy Sons and thy Sons Wives with thee, and bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> went forth and every living thing that was with him after his kind went forth out of the Ark.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Noah</hi> builded an Altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beaſt, and of every clean fowl and offered burnt-offerings on the Altar, and the Lord ſmelled a ſweet ſavour, and the Lord ſaid in his heart, I will not again curſe the earth any more for mans ſake, for the imaginations of his heart are evil from his youth, neither will I again ſmite any more every thing living as I have done; while the earth remaineth, ſeed time and harveſt, cold and heat, Summer and Winter, day and night ſhall not ceaſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>And God bleſſed <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, and ſaid unto them be fruitful and multiply and repleniſh the earth, and the fear of them and the dread of them ſhall be upon every beaſt of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, the power of all living, the living creatures, the Lord delivered into the hands of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, and the Lord ſaid every thing that liveth ſhall be meat for you, even as the green Herb, I have given you all things; but fleſh with the life thereof which is the blood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you ſhall not eat. And ſurely your blood of your lives will I require, at the hand of every beaſt will I require it, and at the hand of man, and at the hand of every mans brother will I require the life of man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4, 5.</p>
               <p>So here the Lord warned them before hand, not to kill one another, as <hi>Cain</hi> had done his brother, no nor the beaſts to kill

And to <hi>Noah</hi> and to his Sons, he ſaid, be fruitful and multiply, and bring forth abundance in the earth, and multiply therein, and behold I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with you, and with your ſeed after you, neither ſhall all fleſh be cut off any more, neither ſhall there any more be a flood to deſtroy the earth; and God ſaid, this is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant that I will make between me and you, I do ſet my Bow in the Cloud, and it ſhall be ſeen in the Cloud, and I will remember my Covenant, and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlaſting Covenant between me and every living Creature of all fleſh upon the earth. And the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> that went forth of the Ark were <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet; Ham</hi> is the Father of <hi>Canaan,</hi> theſe are the three Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of them was the whole earth ſpread.</p>

                  <hi>Abram</hi> removed his Tent and came and dwelt in the plain of <hi>Mamre</hi> which is in <hi>Hebron,</hi> and builded there an Altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord: Then there was a great battel fought about <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Comorrah,</hi> four Kings againſt five made War, and they took <hi>Lot, Abraham</hi>'s brothers Son, a Priſoner, and all his goods.

               <p>This is the interpretation the Apoſtle gives of him, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, ſaith the Apoſtle, how great he is unto whom the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the tenth: Now they that are of the Sons of <hi>Levi;</hi> who receive the Office of Prieſthood, have a commandment to take Tythes according to the Law, but he whoſe deſcent is not counted from them, received Tythes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that had the promiſe, and without all contradiction the leſs is bleſſed of the better, for if he had not been above <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> he could not have bleſſed him, for here men that die, ſaith the Apoſtle, receive Tythes, but there he received them of whom it is witneſſed that he liveth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.8.</p>
               <p>What will it advantage the Prieſts of this age, when they cannot prove by the Levetical Law Tythes to be lawful in theſe days, becauſe they profeſs themſelves to be Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and their Order ſhould be Goſpel-Order; and they bring <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> that he took Tythes, and they bring <hi>Abraham</hi> who

               <p>After theſe things the word of the Lord came to <hi>Abram</hi> in a Viſion, ſaying, Fear not <hi>Abram</hi> I am thy ſhield, and thy exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great reward: and <hi>Abram</hi> ſaid, Lord God what wilt thou give me ſeeing I go childleſs, and one that is born in mine houſe muſt be mine heir: the Lord ſaid, this ſhall not be thine heir, but one that comes out of thine own bowels ſhall be thine heir: and the Lord ſaid, look up towards Heaven, and tell the Stars if thou beeſt able to number them, and he ſaid ſo ſhall thy ſeed be, and <hi>Abram</hi> believed, and it was accounted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Abram</hi> was 99 years old the Lord appeared unto him, and ſaid, walk before me and be thou perfect, and my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhall be with thee, and thou ſhalt be the Father of many

               <p>And according to this the Lod ſent his Angels unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> to confirm unto them that at the time appointed ſhe ſhould bring forth a child: and the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherefore did <hi>Sarah</hi> laugh? ſaying, ſhall I have a child? is any thing too hard for the Lord? at the time appointed will I return unto thee according to the time of life, and <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhall have a Son: ſo at the ſame time, the Lord diſcovered unto <hi>Abraham</hi> what he intended againſt <hi>Sodom.</hi>

And the Lord ſaid, becauſe of the cry of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> is great, and becauſe their ſins are very grievous, I will go down now and ſee whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me, and if not I will know, and the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards <hi>Sodom:</hi>

               <p>And ſo the two Angels came into <hi>Lot</hi>'s houſe, and <hi>Lot</hi> received them kindly, and ſo he and all his houſe were preſerved; the men ſaid unto <hi>Lot,</hi> haſt thou any here beſides thy Son-in-law, and thy Sons and thy Daughters, and whatever thou haſt in the City, bring it out, for we will deſtroy this place, becauſe that the cry of it is waxen great before the Lord, and the Lord hath ſent us to deſtroy it.

               <p>Here was the two Nations and the two ſeeds comprehended and brought forth of one Womb, the Lord foreknowing and foreſeeing this thing as he ſpoke unto <hi>Rebekah,</hi> as the Apoſtle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, that when the Children were yet in the Womb unborn, having done neither good nor evil, that the purpoſe of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the election might ſtand, not of works but of him that calleth; it was ſaid unto her the elder ſhall ſerve the younger; as it is written, <hi>Jacob</hi> have I loved, but <hi>Eſau</hi> have I hated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. of this <hi>Eſau</hi>'s ſtock came the <hi>Edomites,</hi> of which we ſhall ſay more hereafter.</p>

And he ſware to him, and he ſold his birthright unto <hi>Iacob,</hi> then <hi>Iacob</hi> gave <hi>Eſau</hi> bread and pottage of <hi>Lentals,</hi> and he did eat and drink, and roſe up and went his way, thus <hi>Eſau</hi> deſpiſed his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25 26. to the end, according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16, 17. who for one morſel of meat ſold his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>

               <p>Here is a Parable and a myſtery concerning theſe paſſages, for if <hi>Iſaac</hi> had bleſſed <hi>Eſau,</hi> he had bleſſed the wrong birth, for God calls himſelf by the name of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> this is my name and my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial for ever ſaith the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.15.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52673:16"/>of <hi>Iacob, Mat.</hi> 22.32. Certainly <hi>Iacob</hi> was the right ſeed which the bleſſing of the Lord was to; for <hi>Cain</hi> was the firſt birth but he was the wrong ſeed: And ſo <hi>Eſau</hi> was the firſt birth but not the ſeed of the Promiſe which the bleſſing was to, though <hi>Iſaac</hi> loved <hi>Eſau;</hi> if he had given him the bleſſing, it had not been ſo well, but the Lord ordered it otherwiſe: the Apoſtle ſaith, by faith <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the very name of <hi>Iacob</hi> ſignifieth a Supplanter, and ſo he was to ſupplant his Brother and root him out, for <hi>Cain</hi> the elder Brother ſlew his Brother <hi>Abel;</hi> but the Lord hath given <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſecond birth, power over his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> to ſupplant him, and to receive the bleſſing.</p>
               <p>See what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. leſt there be any Fornicator, or prophane perſon, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> who for one morſel of bread ſold his birthright; for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the bleſſing he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears. So it is not tears that come from the wrong nature and birth that will prevail with God, for his promiſe is to the right ſeed, and but to one ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And he was to paſs through the Country of <hi>Edom,</hi> and through the Land of <hi>Seir,</hi> which was his Brother <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Country, and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſent meſſengers before him to his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> he had been twenty years that he had not ſeen him, ſo he did not know whether he would forget his old intention and purpoſe to kill him, therefore he commanded the Meſſengers that he ſent ſaying, thus ſhall ye ſpeak to my Lord <hi>Eſau,</hi> thy ſervant <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith thus, I have ſo journed with <hi>Laban,</hi> and ſtayed there until now, and I have Oxen, Aſſes, Flocks, Men-ſervants, and Women ſervants, and I have ſent to tell my Lord <hi>Eſau,</hi> that I may find grace in thy ſight: and the Meſſengers returned unto <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſaying, we came to thy Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52673:19"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Iacob</hi> was greatly afraid and diſtreſſed, and he divided the people that was with him, and the Flocks and the Herds, and the Camels into two Bands, and ſaid if <hi>Eſau</hi> come to the one company and ſmite it, the other may eſcape. And <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, O God of my Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and God of my Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Lord which ſaid unto me, return into thy Country and to thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant, for with my Staff I paſſed over this <hi>Jondan,</hi> and now I am become two Bands, deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> for I fear him leſt he ſhould come and ſmite me, and the Mother with the Children, and thou ſaideſt I will ſurely do thee good, and make thy ſeed as the ſand of the Sea which cannot be numbred.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Jacob</hi> took 200 She-goats; and 20 He-goats, 200 Ews, and 20 Rams, 30 milch-Camels with their Colts, 40 Kine, and 10 Bulls, twenty She-Aſſes, and ten Foals, and he delivered them unto his Servants, and behold when <hi>Eſau</hi> my Brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, ſaying, whoſe are theſe before thee? thou ſhalt ſay, they be thy ſervant <hi>Iacobs,</hi> it is a Preſent ſent unto my Lord <hi>Eſau,</hi> behold he is behind us, and thus he commanded his Servants to ſay unto <hi>Eſau</hi> when they met him: And ſent his two Wives, and two Women ſervants, and his eleven Sons over the Brook <hi>Jabbock,</hi> and that night <hi>Iacob</hi> was left alone, and there wreſtled a man with him until the breaking of the day, and when he ſaw that he prevailed not againſt him, he touched the hollow of <hi>Iacobs</hi> thigh and it was our of joint as he wreſtled with him; and he ſaid, let me go, for the day breaketh, and he ſaid, I will not let thee go unleſs thou bleſs me; and he ſaid unto him, what is thy name? and he ſaid <hi>Iacob:</hi> and he ſaid thy name ſhall no more be called <hi>Iacob</hi> but <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for as a Prince thou haſt power with God, and with men haſt thou prevailed; and <hi>Iacob</hi> called the name of that place <hi>Peniel,</hi> for I have ſeen God face to face, and my life is preſerved.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iacob</hi> lifted up his eyes, and behold <hi>Eſau</hi> came and with him 400 men, and he divided the Children unto <hi>Leah</hi> and unto

                  <hi>Rachel,</hi> and unto the two Handmaids, and he put the Handmaids and their Children foremoſt, and <hi>Leah</hi> and her Children after, and <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> hindermoſt, and he paſſed over before them, and bowed himſelf to the ground ſeven times, until he came neer unto his Brother, and this he did to ſtop his Brothers fury, who had been enraged againſt him when they parted, for he knew he was a proud man and a great man in the earth, and ſo to allay his ſpirit and get paſt him, for he was to paſs through his Country, did he make this Obeyſance to him; and <hi>Eſau</hi> ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kiſſed him, and they wept, and he lift up his eyes and ſaw the Women and the Children, and he ſaid whoſe are theſe with thee? <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid theſe are the Children which God hath graciouſly given thy ſervant, and the Women and the Children paſſed by him, and they bowed themſelves: and he ſaid what meaneſt thou by all this drove which I meet? And <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid, theſe are to find grace in the ſight of my Lord: and <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaid I have enough my brother, keep that which thou haſt to thy ſelf; and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid, nay I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy ſight, receive my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at my hand, becauſe God hath dealt graciouſly with me, and I have enough, and he urged him, and he took it: And <hi>Eſau</hi> would have gone on his journey with him; but <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid, my Lord knows that the Children are tender, and the flocks are with young, and we muſt lead them on ſoftly, as they are able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Eſau</hi> returned that day unto <hi>Seir,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> journied unto <hi>Succoth,</hi> and came to <hi>Salem,</hi> a City which is in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> And God ſaid unto <hi>Iacob,</hi> ariſe, go up to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and dwell there, and make an Altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fledſt from <hi>Eſau</hi> thy Brother. And <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid to all thoſe that were with him, Let us ariſe and go up to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and let us make there an Altar unto God who anſwered me in the day of my diſtreſs, and was with me in the way which I went. So <hi>Iacob</hi> came to <hi>Luz</hi> which is in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is <hi>Bethel,</hi> and built there an Altar and called upon the Lord; and God appear'd unto <hi>Iacob</hi> again and bleſſed him, and God ſaid unto

               <p>And they journied from <hi>Bethel,</hi> and there was but a little way to come to <hi>Ephrath,</hi> and <hi>Rachel</hi> travelled and had hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and when ſhe was in hard labour, the Midwife ſaid unto her fear not, thou ſhalt have this Son alſo, and it came to paſs as her ſoul was departing, that ſhe called his name <hi>Benonl,</hi> but his Father called his name <hi>Benjamin:</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſet a Pillar upon her Grave, and ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> came unto <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father unto <hi>Mamre,</hi> unto the City of <hi>Arhab</hi> which is <hi>Hebron,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſo journed; and the days of <hi>Iſaac</hi> were one hundred and fourſcore years, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> gave up the Ghoſt and died, and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days, and his Sons <hi>Eſate</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> buried him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.</p>

               <p>The Hiſtory concerning <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> how his Father loved him, and how his brethren envied him, and how they intended to have killed him, and took him and caſt him into a Pit; and how they ſold him to the <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> and he was brought down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Potiphar</hi> an Officer of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> bought him at the hand of the <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> which had carried him down thither, and how the Lord was with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and preſerved him from <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi>'s Wife, how ſhe betrayed him, and accuſed him falſly, but the Lord was with him and ſhewed him mercy, and gave him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the ſight of the Gaoler, and how he came to be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Houſe, and how he governed <hi>Egypt</hi> in the

Chapter to the 46.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iſrael</hi> took his journey with all that he had, and came to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> and offered Sacrifice to the God of his Fathers, and God ſpake unto him in the viſions of the night, and ſaid <hi>Iacob!</hi> and he ſaid here am I.

               <p>So <hi>Iacob</hi> roſe up and went into <hi>Egypt</hi> with his Sons, and their Wives and their little ones were carried in the Waggons that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſent for them; and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> received them kindly and entreated them courteouſly, as you may read in the 46. and 47. Chapter of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> dwelt in the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the Country of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and they had Poſſeſſions there, and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exceedingly, and <hi>Iacob</hi> lived in the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> 17 years, ſo the whole age of <hi>Iacob</hi> was 147 years; and the time drew nigh that <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt die, and he called his Son <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and ſaid unto him, if I have found grace in thy ſight, put I pray thee thine hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me, bury me not I pray thee in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but I will lie with my Fathers, and thou ſhalt carry me out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and bury me in their burying place: And he ſaid I will do as thou haſt ſaid; and he ſaid ſwear unto me, and he ſware unto him, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> bowed himſelf upon his beds head.</p>
               <p>And it came to paſs after theſe things, one told <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſick, and he took with him his two Sons <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> told <hi>Ioſeph</hi> how God appeared to him at <hi>Luz</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and bleſſed him; and he ſaid God ſaid unto me, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and make of thee a multitude of people, and will give this Land to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52673:21"/>thy ſeed after thee, for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, and now thy two Sons <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> which were born in <hi>Egypt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I came, they are mine as much as <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Simeon.</hi> And the Iſſue which thou haſt after them ſhall be thine. And <hi>Iſrael</hi> beheld <hi>Ioſeph</hi>'s Sons, and ſaid, whoſe are theſe? and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaid unto his Father, they are my Sons whom God hath given me in this place; and he ſaid bring them unto me, and I will bleſs them. Now the eyes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were dim that he could not ſee, and he brought them neer unto him, and he kiſſed them and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them: and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> I had not thought to have ſeen thy face, and loe God hath ſhewed me thy ſeed. And <hi>Ioſeph</hi> took them both, <hi>Ephraim</hi> in his right hand towards <hi>Iſraels</hi> left, and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in his left hand towards <hi>Iſraels</hi> right hand, and brought them neer unto him. And <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtretched out his right hand and laid it upon <hi>Ephraims</hi> head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon <hi>Manaſſehs</hi> head, guiding his hands wittingly, for <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was the firſt-born; And he bleſſed <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and ſaid, God before whom my Fathers <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bleſs the Lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my Fathers <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and let them grow into a multitude in the midſt of the earth: And when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaw that his Father laid his right hand upon the head of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> it diſpleaſed him, and he held up his Fathers hand to remove it from <hi>Ephraims</hi> head to <hi>Manaſſehs</hi> head; and ſaid not ſo my Father, for this is the firſt born, and his Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and ſaid, I know it my Son, I know it; he ſhall be great, but truly his younger brother ſhall be greater than he: and he bleſſed them that day, ſaying, in thee ſhall <hi>Iſrael</hi> bleſs; ſaying, God make thee as <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi> And <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> behold I die, but God ſhall be with you, and bring you again into the Land of your Fathers.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iacob</hi> called unto him his Sons, and ſaid, gather your ſelves together, that I may tell you, what ſhall befall you in the laſt days, and hear ye Sons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and hearken unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> your Father; here <hi>Iacob</hi> propheſied unto all his twelve Sons
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52673:22"/>what they ſhould be, and gave every one their ſentence and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but more eſpecially and largely he propheſieth of <hi>Iudah,</hi> of whom our Lord ſprang, and this it the ſeed that we are to treat of; <hi>Iudah</hi> thou art he whom thy brethren ſhall praiſe, thine hand ſhall be in the neck of thine Enemies, thy Fathers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall how down to thee; <hi>Iudah</hi> is a Lions Whelp: from the Prey my Son thou art gone up, he ſtooped down, he couched as a Lion, and as an old Lion, who ſhall rouſe him up.</p>
               <p>The Scepter ſhall not depart from <hi>Iudah,</hi> nor the Law-Giver from between his feet until <hi>Shiloh</hi> come, unto him ſhall the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the people be, binding his foal unto the Vine, and his Aſſes Colt unto the choice Vine; he waſhed his Garments in Wine, and his Cloaths in the bloud of Grapes. His Eyes ſhall be red with Wine, and his teeth white with Milk.</p>
               <p>Here is a holy and a glorious Propheſie of <hi>Iudah,</hi> of which we ſhall ſhew more hereafter; as alſo of all the reſt of his Sons, he propheſied unto them, and told them what ſhould come to paſs to all the 12 Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>So after that he had charged them that they ſhould bury him, and carry him up into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and bury him in that field which <hi>Abraham</hi> had bought, where <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> was buryed, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> his Wife.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iacob</hi> had made an end of commanding his Sons, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the Ghoſt, and was gathered unto his people.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his Brethren carried him up to <hi>Canaan</hi> to bury, and the Elders of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Houſe went along with them, and when they had buryed him, and mourned for him, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his Brethren returned into <hi>Egypt.</hi> So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his Brethren conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was tender and loving to his Brethren.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was 110 years old, he dyed, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> took an Oath of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaying, God will viſit you, and ye ſhall carry my bones from hence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.</p>

               <p>SO <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Sons, their Wives and their Children that went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> with him were ſeventy in number, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> died and all his Brethren and all that Generation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>But their Children encreaſed abundantly, and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty, and the Land was filled with them, and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that was kind and loving to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his brethren, died; and there aroſe a new King in <hi>Egypt</hi> which knew not <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and he ſtormed at the encreaſe of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſaid, they might deal wiſely with them, and ſo he began to afflict them, and ſet Task-Maſters over them, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> made them ſerve with rigour, ſo that they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in Mortar and in Brick, and in all manner of ſervice: and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> charged their Midwives to kill all their Male-children; And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> charged all his people, ſaying, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Son that is born ye ſhall caſt into the River: but the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives feared God, and did not as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had commanded them, but ſaved the Children alive; and the more they afflicted them, the more they grew and multiplied.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how kindly the Lord hath dealt with the ſeed of his promiſe and Covenant, and how often he hath renewed his Promiſes and his Bleſſings and Mercies unto them; hereafter you may ſee alſo how he took care all along of his ſeed, that his Promiſe remained upon, and how he committed them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> whom he preſerved by his power, who was nurſed up by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, as you may read at large in <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And when this cruel King of <hi>Egypt</hi> died, the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> ſighed and groaned under their bondage, and the Lord heard their cry, and God heard their groaning, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and with <hi>Jacob;</hi> and God looked upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and God

               <p>And when God ſaw he turned aſide to ſee, God called unto him out of the buſh and ſaid; <hi>Moſes, Moſes!</hi> and he ſaid, here am I; and he ſaid draw not nigh hither, put off thy ſhoes from thy feet, for the place where thou ſtandeſt is holy ground: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he ſaid, I am the God of thy Fathers, the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob:</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God; and the Lord ſaid, I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of my people which are in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and have heard their cry by reaſon of their Task-Maſters, for I know their ſorrows, and I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and to bring them up out of that Land into a good Land: come now therefore, I will ſend thee unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that thou mayeſt bring my people the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for I have heard their cries and ſeen their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
               <p>Here the Lord committed his ſeed into the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> a faithful Servant, who came of <hi>Lavi</hi> both by Father and Mother, which was <hi>Jacobs</hi> third Son.

               <p>Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> went in and told <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſaying, thus ſaith the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> let my people go that they may hold a Feaſt unto me in the Wilderneſs. And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid, who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice, to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, Chap. 5. So he cauſed the greater Tasks to be laid upon them, that they ſhould make their tale of Bricks without ſtraw, as you may read; and the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> Now thou ſhalt ſee what I will do unto <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And God ſpake unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſaid, I am the Lord, and I appeared unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> by the name of God Almighty, but by my name <hi>Iehovah</hi> was I not known to them, and have alſo eſtabliſhed my Covenant with them to give them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of their Pilgrimage wherein they were ſtrangers, and I have alſo heard the groaning of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom the <hi>Egyptians</hi> keep in bondage, and I remember my Covenant: wherefore ſay unto the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I am the Lord, and I will bring you from under the burdens of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and I will rid you out of their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and I will redeem you with a ſtretched out arm, and with great Judgments; and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you for a God, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the bondage of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and I will bring you into the Land, concerning the which I ſware to give it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and I will give it to you for an heritage, I am the Lord, Chap. 6.8. So <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as you may read to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>And the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſee I have made thee a God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> thy brother a Prophet, and thou ſhalt ſpeak all that I command; and <hi>Aaron</hi> thy Brother ſhall ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he ſend the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of his Land, and I will harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chap. 7.

               <p>Now there was a man of <hi>Benjamins</hi> Tribe whoſe name was <hi>Kiſh,</hi> and he had a Son whoſe name was <hi>Saul,</hi> a choiſe young man and goodly, higher from the ſhoulders upward than any of the People, as you may read in the 9.

               <p>Then came the word of the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſaying, it repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me that I have ſet up <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my Commandments; and it grieved <hi>Samuel,</hi> and he cryed to the <hi>Lord</hi> all night, and <hi>Samuel</hi> roſe early in the morning to meet <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him bleſſed be thou of the <hi>Lord,</hi> I have performed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid what meaneth this bleating of the Sheep and lowing of the Oxen in mine ears? and <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid the people have ſaved the beſt of the Sheep, and of the Oxen to ſacrifice to the <hi>Lord</hi> thy <hi>God,</hi> and the reſt we have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed.

               <p>And <hi>Samuel</hi> did that which the Lord ſpake, and came unto <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the Elders of the Town trembled at his coming, and ſaid comeſt thou peaceably? and he ſaid peaceably I am come to ſacrifice unto the Lord, ſanctifie your ſelves and come to the ſacrifice with me, and he ſanctified <hi>Jeſse</hi> and his Sons, and called them to the Sacrifice, and <hi>Samuel</hi> looked on <hi>Jeſſes</hi> Sons, and <hi>Jeſse</hi> made ſeven of his Sons to paſs before <hi>Samuel:</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the Lord hath not choſen theſe, and he ſaid, are here all thy children? and he ſaid there remaineth yet the youngeſt, and behold he keepeth the Sheep; and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> ſend and fetch him, for we will not ſit down till he come hither; and he ſent and brought him in <hi>David:</hi> Now he was ruddy and withall of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to; and the Lord ſaid ariſe, annoint him, for this is he: then <hi>Samuel</hi> took the horn of Oyl and annointed him in the midſt of his Brethren; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon <hi>David</hi> from that day forward. Here the Lord annointed <hi>David</hi> to be King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his Prophet, and by his eternal Spirit, but this was hid from <hi>Saul</hi> many years, as you may read from <hi>Chap.</hi> 16, to 23.</p>
               <p>And how the Lord was with <hi>David</hi> in all his undertakings, and how he was preſerved from the wrath and fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> and

               <p>And the Armies of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> gathered together againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> enquired of the Lord, ſaying, ſhall I purſue after this Troop, ſhall I overtake them? and he anſwered, purſue them, and without fail recover all: So <hi>David</hi> went and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men that were with him, four hundred purſued, and two hundred ſtayed behind, and <hi>David</hi> recovered all that the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> carryed away, and <hi>David</hi> recovered his two Wives, and there was nothing lacking, neither ſmall nor great, neither Sons nor Daughters, neither flocks nor herds, but <hi>David</hi> recovered them all and came to the two hundred men that ſtayed behind, that were ſo faint they could not follow him.</p>
               <p>Now after this the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> fought againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> that was under <hi>Saul,</hi> and the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled before the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and the Battel went ſore againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> and the Archers hit him and he was ſore wounded; and <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid unto his Armour-Bearer, draw thy Sword and thruſt me through, but his Armour-Bearer would not, therefore <hi>Saul</hi> took a ſword and fell upon it, and when his Armour-Bearer ſaw that <hi>Saul</hi> was dead, he fell likewiſe upon his ſword and died with him; ſo <hi>Saul</hi> died and his three Sons and his Armour-Bearer and all his men fell that day together, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.</p>

And the ſpeech pleaſed the Lord, that <hi>Solomon</hi> asked this thing; and God ſaid, becauſe thou haſt asked this thing, and haſt not asked long life, neither haſt asked riches to thy ſelf, nor haſt asked the life of thine Enemies, but haſt asked for thy ſelf underſtanding to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern Judgment, behold I have done according to thy words, I have given thee a wiſe and underſtanding heart, ſo that there was none like thee before thee, neither ſhall any ariſe after thee like unto thee, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>So King <hi>Solomon</hi> reigned over all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as you may read in the fourth and fifth Chapters. And it came to paſs in four hundred and fourſcore years after the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were come out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the fourth year of <hi>Solomons</hi> reign over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the month <hi>Zif,</hi> which is the ſecond month, that he began to build the Houſe of the Lord; of which building and the magnificency of it you may read from the ſixth Chapter to the ninth Chapter of 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſembled the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and all the heads of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that they might bring up the Ark of the Covenant of God out of the

               <p>And it came to paſs when <hi>Solomon</hi> had furniſhed the building of the Houſe of the Lord and the Kings Houſe, that the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſecond time, and the Lord ſaid unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy ſupplication that thou haſt made before me, I have hallowed this houſe which thou haſt built, to put my name there for ever, and if thou walk before me as <hi>David</hi> thy Father walked, in integrity of heart, and in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, to do according to all that I command thee, and keep my Statutes and Judgments, then will I eſtabliſh the Throne of thy Kingdom upon <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So King <hi>Solomon</hi> excelled all the Kings of the earth for riches and for wiſdom, and the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> heard of the ſame of <hi>Solomon</hi> concerning the name of the Lord, ſhe came to prove him with hard queſtions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>After this King <hi>Solomon</hi> loved many ſtrange women, together with the Daughters of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi> and <hi>Zidonians,</hi> and <hi>Hittites,</hi> all which the Lord had commanded the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they ſhould not go into them.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Solomon</hi> was drawn away with his Wives, and worſhipped their Gods, and made Idols, and the Lord was angry with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which had appeared to him twice, wherefore the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> for as much as this is done of thee, and thou haſt not kept my Covenant and my Statutes which I commanded thee, I will ſurely rent the Kingdom from thee, and give it to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, notwithſtanding in thy days I will not do it for <hi>David</hi> my ſervants ſake, but I will rend it out of the hand of thy Son, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I will not rend away all the Kingdom, but will give one Tribe to thy Son for <hi>David</hi> my ſervants ſake, and for <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> ſake which I have choſen.</p>
               <p>And it came to paſs when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> went out of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that

               <p>

               <p>And when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he gathered of the Houſe of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> an hundred and fourſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand choſen men, which were Warriours, to fight againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſo he might bring the ten Tribes to him again, which <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat</hi> went about to take from him, for they were given to him; but the word of the Lord came to <hi>Shemaiah</hi> the man of God, ſaying, ſpeak unto <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and to all <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſaying thus ſaith the Lord, ye ſhall not go up to ſight againſt your Brethren, return every man to his houſe for this thing is done of me, and they obeyed the word of the Lord and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from going againſt <hi>Jeroboam.</hi>

               <p>And thus far you may ſee how the Lord hath dealt with his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and how faithful he hath been in his promiſes to their forefathers, and the tender eye and care he had over them all along, and how gladly he would have had them to have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Commandments and his Statutes, that they might have lived to him, you may read through theſe afore mentioned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies; and notwithſtanding that they did rebel againſt him, and did grievouſly provoke him through their manifold abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52673:49"/>yet you ſee how careful he was of them, and faithful to them, and according to the Propheſies of the Prophets brought them back again to their own City.</p>
               <p>But this was not all, there is much behind yet, for the Decree and Determination of the Lord was a further thing, and theſe peculiar people which the Lord did chuſe above all the Families of the earth, they were a figure of the right, and ture, and precious ſeed of God; and though they were a people as you ſee that had often rebelled againſt the Lord, and fallen away from him, and murmured againſt him, as you may ſee they did often in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, when the Lord had ſet <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> over them, as you may ſee, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. and all the Congregation lift up their voices and cryed, and the people wept; and the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the whole Congregation ſaid, would God we had died in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> would God that we had died in the Wilderneſs, and wherefore hath the Lord brought us up to this Land? our Wives and our Children to be a Prey? were it not better for us to return into <hi>Egypt?</hi> let us make us a Captain, and let us return into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>Here you may ſee how they requited the Lord, and how evilly they dealt with him for all his mercies, and his wonders which he wrought for them, and many a time did they murmur and rebel againſt the Lord, while <hi>Moſes</hi> led them through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; even forty years long was the Lord grieved with them, and tempted with them, till he even ſwore in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt; and all along ever ſince you may ſee how ill they dealt with the Lord, and continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to anger by their abominations and worſhipping of other Gods, inſomuch that he complains by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> hear O Heavens, and give ear O earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken, I have nouriſhed and brought up Children, and they have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt me, the Oxe knows his owner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you may read through the firſt Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>

               <p>Thus the Lord performed his faithful Covenant and promiſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, of whom according to the fleſh, Chriſt came.

               <p>And ſo, notwithſtanding that they broke their Covenant with the Lord, which ſtood in outward performances, yet the Lord performed his promiſe and Covenant unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is the ſeed Chriſt, which the Lord calls a new and everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33.

               <p>And for this end is Chriſt Jeſus come a light into the world, not only to the Jews, but to the whole world, for he came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own, even unto his Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> which was at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but his own received him not; but as many of them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, not only of them but the whole world, for to that end is he come, that whoſoever believes on him, they ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting, life.</p>
               <p>For he is come a light, and hath enlightned the whole world, and every man that comes into the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. So every one that comes into the world, that turns his mind unto the light of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, turns his mind to the elected ſeed which the Lord hath choſen, which he hath laid in <hi>Sion</hi> for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And therefore thus ſaith the Lord, behold I lay in <hi>Sion</hi> for a foundation, a ſtone, a tryed ſtone, a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation, that lays judgment to the Line, and righteouſneſs to the Plummet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28.16.

               <p>Wherefore the Apoſtle ſaith, the Law is our Schoolmaſter to bring us unto Chriſt, for there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, and if ye be Chriſts, then are ye <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe: now the heir ſo long as he is a child is under Tutors and Governours, and differs nothing from a ſervant though he be Lord of all; ſo even we who are of the precious ſeed, while we are Children, are in bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Elements of the world; but when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem the ſeed that was under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons; and becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying <hi>Abba</hi> Father: wherefore thou art no more a ſervant but a Son, then an heir of God through Chriſt.</p>

               <p>For the love of Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, conſtraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead, and that he dyed for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them and roſe again: So by his Reſurrection he judgeth all thoſe that live to themſelves and not unto him that dyed for them and roſe again.</p>
               <p>So alſo by his Reſurrection he judgeth all thoſe that live unto themſelves: This is the condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil: If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin; but now they have no cloak for their ſin; he that hateth me, hateth my Father alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.21. for as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raiſeth up the dead, even ſo the Son quickeneth whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will; for the Father judgeth no man, but hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all judgment to the Son, that all men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Father; he that honoureth not the Son,

And there is no other way nor name under Heaven by which any man can be ſaved (the Apoſtle ſaith) but by Jeſus Chriſt, and he is the foundation of all the Prophets and all the Apoſtles,

Let all ſuch as draw from this and deſerts from this, read their portion in the 10. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and they ſhall be ſure of it; for the Lord is not ſlack concerning his coming, neither will alter the word that is gone out of his mouth. And all who are not of the right ſeed and ſpirit and life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, all ſuch will be judged by him and condemned by him; for if thoſe that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law dyed under the hand of two or three witneſſes, how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall they be thought worthy of, who have trodden under foot, and counted the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and hath done deſpight to the Spirit of Grace? but vengeance belongeth unto me ſaith the Lord, and I will recompenſe.</p>

               <p>There was War in Heaven, then the true Worſhip of God was loſt, and that eternal Spirit which was in the Apoſtles, where the wicked one had no part, but they had overcome the wicked one, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.

               <p>That Spirit was loſt which was among the Apoſtles, they ſat together in heavenly places in Chriſt Ieſus, as you may read <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. and Chap. 2.6.</p>
               <p>And Ieſus exhorted his Diſciples to lay up their treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for he ſaid, where the treaſure is there the heart will be alſo, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.20, 21.</p>
               <p>But this worſhip of God and power was loſt when the Woman ſled into the Wilderneſs,
<note place="margin">The Church of Chriſt gone into the Wilderneſs.</note> and then the Dragon got up and made War in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and to this agrees that Propheſie of Chriſt, where he ſaith, the powers of the Heavens ſhall be ſhaken, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. but <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his Angels, as you may read in the 10. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> after <hi>Daniel</hi> had mourned three full weeks, and had eaten no pleaſant bread, neither came Wine in his mouth until three full weeks were fulfilled, after this <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw the Viſions and heard the voice that ſaid fear not <hi>Daniel,</hi> for from the firſt day that thou ſetteſt thine heart to underſtand, and to chaſten thy ſelf before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52673:59"/>but the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia</hi> withſtood me many days, but loe <hi>Michael</hi> one of the chief Princes came to help me; now I am come to make thee underſtand what ſhall befall thy people in the laſt days, for yet the Viſion is for many days, and after this <hi>Daniel</hi> became dumb and fell upon the ground, and retained no ſtrength, neither was breath left in him; then the Angel came again and touched him (as you may read) and ſaid knoweſt thou wherefore I am come unto thee, and now I will return and ſight with the Prince of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and when I am come forth, loe the Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> ſhall come, which is the third Monarchy, but I will ſhew thee that which is noted in the Scriptures of truth, and there is none that holdeth with me in theſe things but <hi>Michael</hi> the Prince, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. So <hi>Michael</hi> ſtood for the Angel there in the days of <hi>Daniel</hi> againſt the power of the Dragon, this <hi>Michael</hi> the Apoſtle calls the Archangel, <hi>Jude</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>And ſo here in the Apoſtacy <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels have fought againſt the Dragon and his Angels, for they prevailed not, while the woman hath been in the Wilderneſs, for it is a place prepared of God for her, that ſhe ſhould be fed there a thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and threeſcore days; but after this <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Dragon caſt out, that old Serpent called the Devil and Satan which had deceived the whole world, there was no more place for him in Heaven, but he was caſt out into the earth, and his Angels were caſt out with him, when the true and precious ſeed of the body, which is Chriſt, which is his Church, appeared again, in which the wicked one hath no part, then there was no place ſound in Heaven for the Dragon, therefore, ſaith <hi>Iohn,</hi> Rejoyce, ye Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ye that dwell in them, woe unto the Inhabitants of the Earth and of the Sea, for the Devil is come down unto you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great wrath, becauſe he knoweth his time is but ſhort; this is very truly witneſſed and fulfilled at this day: for where the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is witneſſed, and where his ſeed is raiſed up in any, where the Spirit of Satan hath no place in their Worſhip, but they worſhip in the Spirit of the Lord and in his Truth, then Satan rages in the Inhabitants of the Earth and of the Sea, whither he is caſt; for in their Heaven and in their Worſhip
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52673:60"/>he is there, making war: but where he is caſt out from Heaven, there he perſecutes the Woman that brings forth the man-child, and is wroth with her, and makes war with the remnant of her ſeed which keeps the Commandements of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17.</p>
               <p>And in the next Chapter, when <hi>John</hi> ſtood upon the ſand of the Sea, which was but a brittle foundation, for it was to be done away, there he ſaw the beaſt ariſe out of the Sea with his ſeven heads and ten horns and his ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of Blaſphemy, as you may read throughout that 13. Chapter to the end: but afterwards <hi>John</hi> ſaw an Angel ſlying in the midſt of Heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth, and he cryed with a loud voice unto every Nation and Tongue and People and Kindred, ſaying, Fear God and give glory to him, and worſhip him that made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and the Fountains of waters.</p>
               <p>The Book which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw ſealed with ſeven Seals, which he mentions in the 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> he ſaw the Lamb open it in the 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> as you may read; and ſo here, there followeth another Angel, ſaying, <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, is fallen, that great City, becauſe ſhe hath made all Nations drunk with the wine of her fornication, as you may read <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And in the 15. Chapter <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the ſeven Angels having the ſeven laſt plagues, for in them is filled up the wrath of God; and one of the four beaſts gave unto the ſeven Angels ſeven golden Vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever: and in the 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> he ſaw the ſeven Angels go forth, and they poured out their Vials, as you may read; and in the 17 <hi>Chap.</hi> there came one of the ſeven Angels which had the ſeven Vials, and he ſaid, come up hither, and I will ſhew thee the judgment of the great Whore. So he carried me away (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) in the Spirit into the wilderneſs, here was the place where the true Church was perſecuted, here was the place where the Dragon caſt out his flood after the true Church to deſtroy her.</p>
               <p>And ſaith <hi>Iohn,</hi> I ſaw a Woman ſitting upon a Scarlet-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beaſt, full of names of Blaſphemy, having ſeven heads and ten
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52673:60"/>horns, and the Angel ſhewed him the Myſtery of the Beaſt, and of his horns, as you may read throughout that 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> and in the 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> he ſaw <hi>Babylon</hi> deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>So here is comfort for all the true ſeed of Gods Elect: for <hi>Iohn</hi> heard the voices of much people in Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Halelujah,</hi> Salvation, Glory and Honour; and a voice came out of the Throne, ſaying, praiſe our God, all ye that fear him, ſmall and great, let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her ſelf ready, and to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linnen, white and clean: for the fine linnen is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints; and he ſaid unto me, write, Bleſſed are they which are called to the Marriage-ſupper of the Lamb, and he ſaith unto me, theſe are the true ſayings of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. as you may read throughout <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>And in the 20. <hi>Chap. Iohn</hi> ſaw the Angel come down from Heaven, having the key of the Bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand, and he laid hold on the Dragon, and bound him a thouſand years, as you may read.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God, and the Books were opened, and the dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in theſe Books; and another Book was opened, which is the Book of life, and whoſoever was not found written in the Book of life, was caſt into the Lake of fire, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>And in the 21. <hi>Chap. Iohn</hi> ſaw a new Heaven and a new Earth,
<note place="margin">The Church coming forth of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</note> here was no Dragon in this Heaven; for the firſt Heaven and the firſt Earth were paſſed away, and there was no more Sea, where the Dragon lodgeth and hath his way, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.1.</p>
               <p>And I <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the holy City, new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband: here the Holy Spirit of the Lord God cloaths her ſeed that hath ſo long laid deſolate, as a nouriſhing mother which is free, and gives liberty, and ſets at liberty all her free-born which are not Children of the Bond-woman but of the free: and of this glorious City doth the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſie, when he ſaid,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52673:61"/>Rejoyce, O Barren, that didſt not bear; and this is the City which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all, of all the free-born ſeed of the promiſe, they are the Heirs: but the Bond-woman and her Son are to be caſt out of this holy City, for he is not the Heir, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iohn</hi> heard a great voice out of Heaven, ſaying, Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God: and he that ſat upon the Throne, ſaid, behold I make all things new, that is, according as the Apoſtle ſaith, if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature, old things are paſt away, behold I make all things new, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. and he ſaid unto me, write, for theſe words are true and faithful, and he ſaid unto me, it is done, I am <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the end, I will give unto him that is athirſt of the fountain of the water of life freely: Here is the rich bounty of God.</p>
               <p>And there came one of the ſeven Angels unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> which had the ſeven vials of the ſeven laſt plagues, and he ſaid come hither, and I will ſhew thee the Bride the Lambs wife, and he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, he ſhewed me that great City, the holy <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> deſcending out of Heaven from God, having the Glory of God, and her light was like unto a ſtone moſt precious, even like a Jaſper ſtone clear as Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal.</p>
               <p>This is the Stone the Builders have diſallowed, which now is become the Head of the Corner of this precious and holy build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is made up of living ſtones, elect and precious, and of a Royal Prieſthood, and of an holy Nation; and the Walls of this City had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve Angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and the Walls of this City had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb, and the foundation of the City was garniſhed with twelve precious ſtones, and the twelve gates were twelve Pearls, every gate was of one Pearl; he that underſtands, reads and ſees all theſe things.</p>

               <p>And I <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw no Temple in this City; for the Lord God and the Lamb is the Temple of it.</p>
               <p>And this City hath no need of the Sun or the Moon to ſhine in it; for the Glory of the Lord doth enlighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof, and the Nations of all them that are ſaved, ſhall walk in the light of it, and the Kings of the Earth that are ſaved, ſhall bring their glory and honour to it, and the gates of it are not at all ſhut by day, yet there entereth not any thing that deſileth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.27.</p>
               <p>And in the 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> you may read how <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the pure River of water of life, proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb, and the tree of life which bears twelve manner of fruits, and yields her fruits every month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the Nations: and he ſaid, theſe things are faithful and true, and the Lord God of the holy Prophets ſent his Angel to ſhew unto his Servant the things which muſt ſhortly be done.</p>
               <p>For the Lord God had propheſied of theſe things before by the Prophets, and by Chriſt Jeſus, and his Apoſtles; and ſaith unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſeal not the Propheſie of the ſayings of this Book, for the time is at hand, and behold I come quickly, for my reward is with me, to give unto every one according to his works: And I am <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end, the firſt and the laſt, bleſſed are they that do his Commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the City; I Jeſus have ſent mine Angel to teſtifie unto you theſe things to the Churches; I am the Root and Off-ſpring of <hi>David,</hi> and the bright morning Star, and the Spirit and the Bride ſaith come, and let him that heareth, ſay come, and let him that is athirſt come, and whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.</p>

                  </gap>lterable he is, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52673:62"/>what love and faithful care he hath had over his ſeed, ever ſince he made man, and gave him a being upon the Earth: but indeed his love is everlaſting, for he had elected, and decreed, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Salvation and Redemption to his ſeed, before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world was; and becauſe he could not alter nor change, therefore his ſeed was preſerved, as you may read in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of the Scriptures, becauſe I change not, therefore ye Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> are not conſumed; and if the Lord had not left us this ſeed, we had been as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and like unto <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by this little tract that we have gone through the Scriptures ſince the Lord made man, you may read the long-ſuffering and the patience of the Lord God, and his kind dealing, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care over his ſeed, even when they rebelled againſt him, and that becauſe of his faithfulneſs in keeping of his promiſes and Covenants, which he ſo often promiſed and covenanted (as hath been ſhewed) not only unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and unto <hi>Iacob,</hi> but alſo unto <hi>David,</hi> as you may read at large in the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and in <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and the Book of Pſalms, often hath he redoubled his promiſes unto <hi>David</hi> and unto his ſeed for ever, that as his Covenant was with the day and with the night, ſo is his Covenant with <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed for ever; and as he had ſworn that the Waters ſhould not go over the Earth, ſo he had ſworn that his Bleſſing and Covenant ſhould be with <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed for ever, which he hath faithfully performed: of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> he hath ſent his Son. And ſo the Lord hath led them along (as you may read thorow this Treatiſe) until Chriſt, and according to his promiſe Chriſt came, and took not upon him (as Apoſtle ſaith) the Nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> for he was made a little lower then the Angels for the ſuffering of death, crowned with Glory and Honour, that he by the Grace of God ſhould taſt of death for every man, as you may read in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And he that thought it no robbery to be equal with the great God, yet he took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of man, and being found in the faſhion of a man, he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52673:62"/>humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto the death, even the death of the Croſs; wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name better then every name, that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, and every tongue confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the Glory of the Father, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>So he hath gone thorow this great Work, and finiſhed it (for as the Apoſtle ſaith) ſo it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, to make the Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfect through ſufferings: for in the days of his fleſh he offered up prayers and ſupplications,
<note place="margin">Chriſts Sufferings</note> with ſtrong crying and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard; and though he was a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things that he ſuffered, and being made perfect through ſufferings, he became the Author of Eternal Salvation unto all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>So the price he hath paid, and mans Salvation and Redemption he hath purchaſed by his own blood (as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith) Jeſus Chriſt who is the faithful and true Witneſs, the firſt begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, unto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>And he according to his promiſe unto his Diſciples, that he would pour down his Spirit upon them, and ſend them another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, and bad them ſtay at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> till the Spirit was poured on them from on high, which was plentifully and richly fulfilled, as the Scripture teſtifies; for they were made partakers of it in a plentiful manner; and the Apoſtles were made able Miniſters of the Spirit, by which they begat multitudes unto God and to the true Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus; ſo that the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel ſhone gloriouſly among them, and Chriſt had a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church at that day, as thoſe Epiſtles which the Apoſtles wrote to the Churches, being left upon Record, bears a true teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the holy Spirit that was in them, and all that live in the Spirit of the living God, and is endowed and enriched with it, bears witneſs to the Scriptures, that they were given forth by the holy Spirit of God, and by the inſpiration of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>But we may ſee that Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles had a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52673:63"/>and a knowledge of the beauty and glory of this Church, being vailed, and that the night of Apoſtacy and darkneſs would come over, as hath been already ſhewed, and as you may read in the Scriptures, which hath been fulfilled, as experience of many ages can teſtifie: for by moſt of the Records that we can find, it is above twelve hundred years ſince the glorious beauty of the Church of Chriſt was ſtained; but all this hath not come to paſs without the fore-knowledge of the holy Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And ſo now bleſſed and honoured be the glorious God, our lot is fallen in a good Land, and our time is a time of love; and as we are fallen into the laſt age of the world, ſo alſo we are riſen with Chriſt Jeſus the Sun of Righteouſneſs, who ariſeth with healing in his wings; and now the light of the glorious Goſpel hath ſhined in our hearts, and hath given us the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of the inviſible God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; and this Goſpel of the Kingdom of God we are willing and ready to preach throughout the whole world: for we wait, and expect, and groan within our ſelves for the redemption of our body, the elected precious ſeed, which is the Church of Chriſt, which the Lord of Heaven and Earth hath had an eye unto continually; yet ſince the foundation of the world, this ſeed hath ſuffered, and been bruiſed, and ſlain; but certainly we are aſſured that as the Lord hath performed that part of his Word, that it ſhould ſuffer, he will alſo perform that part of his Word that hath ſaid, the ſeed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</p>
               <p>For according to this Word, in the fulneſs of time he ſent his Son made of a Woman, and as certainly as the Church and body of Chriſt hath gone into the wilderneſs, ſo certainly her Child that ſhe brought forth, which hath been caught up to God and to his Throne, ſhall come down, and rule all Nations with his rod of iron, and daſh to pieces, as a Potters veſſel, all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: this we wait for, and are aſſured ſhall come to paſs, that the elected ſeed which is choſen of God, and precious, which is the body that he hath prepared to do his will, Chriſt Jeſus which is come, is the reſurrection and life of all his ſeed, and the hope of

               </p>
               <p>And ſurely he will gather his Elect from the four winds, from one end of the Heaven to the other; and it is for the Elects ſake that theſe days are ſhortned: for except theſe days had been ſhortned, no fleſh could have been ſaved, and Chriſt ſaith, ſhall not God avenge his own Elect that hath cryed unto him night and day, I tell you he will avenge them ſpeedily, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he exhorteth his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> conſider what I ſay (ſaith he) and the Lord give thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in all things; remember that Jeſus Chriſt, the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> was raiſed from the dead, according to my Goſpel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſuffer trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the Word of God is not bound, therefore I endure all things for the Elects ſake, that they alſo may obtain the Salvation which is in Chriſt Jeſus in eternal glory, who now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh, for his bodies ſake, which is the Chruch, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24.</p>
               <p>It is a faithful ſaying, if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him; if we deny him, he will alſo deny us; if we believe nor, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf. So this was that which the Apoſtles looked for, and waited for the Redemption of the body, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and they ſuffered all things for the bodies ſake; ſo the Reſurrection of this body, is that Chriſt Jeſus accompliſheth, who ſaith, I am the reſurrection and the life, he that believes in me though he were dead yet ſhall he live, and he that lives and believes ſhall never die; I am the Fountain, if any man thirſt let him come unto me, and out of his belly ſhall flow Rivers of living water; and this he ſpoke of the Spirit that was to be poured forth, and by this Spirit doth he redeem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his elected ſeed: and ſo the Apoſtles reckoned the ſufferings of this preſent life not worthy to be compared to the glory that was to be revealed, becauſe of the expectation of the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sons of God.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52673:64"/>
               <p>And this the great Husbandman is now looking for, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up, who hath long waited for his Crop, as he did when he ſaw the multitudes come unto him, he was moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them, becauſe they fainted, and were ſcattered abroad as Sheep having no Shepherd; then ſaith he unto his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, the Harveſt truly is plenteous, but the Labourers are few, pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harveſt that he ſend forth pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Labourers into his Harveſt, here the Lord deſired the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſeed.</p>

Here Chriſt brings a compariſon by a Parable of his great Harveſt, and when Jeſus had ſhewed the Parable of the Tares, his Diſciples came unto him, and deſired him to declare that Parable; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid unto them, he that ſoweth the good ſeed is the Son of man, the Field is the world, the good Seed are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom, but the Tares are the Children of the wicked one, the Enemy that ſoweth them is the Devil, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is the end of the World, and the Reapers are the Angels; the Son of man will ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and ſhall caſt them into the Furnace of Fire, then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father: who hath ears to hear, let him hear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p>And when the Lord ſent forth the ſeventy Diſciples he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the Harveſt truly is great but the Labourers are few, pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harveſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. This is the great Lord of the great Harveſt, this is the great Husbandman; I am the true Vine, ſaith Chriſt, my Father is the Husbandman, every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away, every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth, that it may bring forth more fruit; herein is my Father glorified, that you bring forth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52673:64"/>much fruit: So herein is the glory of the Husbandman that fruits be brought forth.</p>
               <p>And this great and mighty Husbandman hath been patient, and waited patiently for the precious fruit, and had long patience for it, according to <hi>James</hi> 5.7. for he did ſow his ſeed in <hi>Adam,</hi> above five thouſand ſix hundred years ſince, ſo as he made the world and created all things in ſix days, ſo he hath husbanded and tilled and pruned and dreſſed and watered it well towards ſix thouſand years; and to this agrees the Apoſtles words, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. to 8. when he ſaith, one day with the Lord is as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day; for God is not ſlack concerning his coming, as ſome men count ſlackneſs. In <hi>Adam</hi> he ſowed his ſeed a natural body, and this the Apoſtle very well opens in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. where he ſpeaks at large of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body, after he had been ſpeaking how the Apoſtles had ſeen Chriſt after he was riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p>Now if Chriſt be preached (ſaith the Apoſtle) that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you, that there is no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead? <hi>ver.</hi> 12. but if there be no Reſurrection of the dead, then is not Chriſt riſen; this is very true, for by the Reſurrection of Chriſt the dead ariſes, by preaching of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and ye are yet in your ſins, then alſo they which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſh'd; but now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruits of them that ſleep: for ſince by man came death, by man alſo came the reſurrection of the dead; for as in <hi>Adam</hi> all died, ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive: there is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body, ſaith the Apoſtle. And ſome men will ſay, how are the dead raiſed? and with what body do they come? thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened except it die, and that which thou ſoweſt is not the body which ſhall be, for that thou ſoweſt muſt die that it may encreaſe, God giveth it a body as it pleaſeth him, but to every ſeed its own body: ſo whatſoever ſeed thou ſoweſt, whether it be Wheat or any other grain, though that which thou ſoweſt die in the ground that it may encreaſe, yet it bringeth forth its own body, its own nature, its own image.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:52673:65"/>
               <p>And to this agrees Chriſts own words in <hi>John</hi> 12. where he ſaith, verily I ſay unto you, except a corn of Wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit; this he ſpake when he ſaw his hour was coming, and he ſaid Father ſave me from this hour, but for this cauſe came I unto this hour, <hi>Job.</hi> 12 24. to the 27.</p>
               <p>And now this great Husbandman, the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he did ſow his ſeed in <hi>Adam,</hi> and it died, that it might encreaſe in Chriſt Jeſus, who is the reſurrection and the life of this ſeed: and the Lord hath watched and waited, and had an eye over his Vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.1. as we have ſhewed throughout this Treatiſe: but the Apoſtle goes on farther, and ſpeaks of the glory of the Sun, and of the Moon, and of the Stars, and ſaith, ſo alſo is it in the Reſurrection; it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory, it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power, it is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body; for ſo it is written, the firſt man was made a living ſoul, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> a quickening ſpirit; howbeit that <hi>Adam</hi> was not firſt which is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iritual, but that <hi>Adam</hi> which is natural, and afterwards that which is ſpiritual; the firſt man of the earth earthy, the ſecond man the Lord from Heaven: as is the earthy, ſuch are they alſo that are earthy; as is the heavenly, ſuch are they that are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; and as we have born the image of the earthy, ſo ſhall we bear the image of the heavenly: Now I ſay unto you Brethren, that fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, and ſo on to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>And this is the earthy, that which is of the firſt man, fleſh and blood, which muſt not inherit incorruption; and this is the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that we witneſs and wait for, the ſpiritual body, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual image, the ſpiritual life, the quickening ſpirit, the Lord from Heaven, the gathering of the immortal ſeed to the great Lord of the Harveſt, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that he deſires his Diſciples to pray for, to ſend forth painful Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers into his harveſt: So the great God is now coming to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his great Harveſt and his Crop that he hath ſown ſo long ſince (and the Angels are his Reapers) and waited for,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52673:65"/>and watched over, as you may read through this Book.</p>
               <p>And to this agrees that which Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Math.</hi> 25. when the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the Throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as the Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats, and he ſhall ſet the Sheep on his right hand, but the Goats on his left, <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 32, 33. and ſo ſhall the reſurrection of the juſt be to life, and the reſurrection of the unjuſt unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: this is the Reſurrection that all ſhall find and may expect, for Chriſt hath been (as he ſaith in this Chapter) as one in a far Country, and hath called his ſervants, and hath delivered unto them his Talents, and as every one hath gained and profited ſo ſhall they receive.</p>
               <p>So it is required of every one to know the precious ſeed which God hath elected and choſen for himſelf; of all ſeeds he hath choſen but one, the precious ſeed, though it be likened unto a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds, but is the moſt precious and pure and holy ſeed, becauſe it came from the life and breath of the immortal pure God, whoſe life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality dwells in eternal light and eternal brightneſs: So the Lord by his glorious word and power is gathering in again his precious and holy ſeed, and renewing and reſtoring a far more and exceeding weight of glory than what was the glory of the firſt man, the glory of the ſecond man far exceeded it; for as the Apoſtle ſaith, the firſt man was made a living Soul, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>David</hi> ſaith, he was made a little lower than the Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. what is man that thou art ſo mindful of him? and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him? for thou haſt made him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower than the Angels, and haſt crowned him with glory and honour, thou haſt made him to have Dominion over the works of thy hands, thou haſt put all things under his feet: which words the Apoſtle rehearſeth again in the 2. of <hi>Heb.</hi> and ſaith, that he left nothing that was not put under him, then in that ſtate that he then ſtood in, which was before the Fall; but now (ſaith the Apoſtle) we ſee not all things put under him: why?
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52673:66"/>becauſe he was come under in his tranſgreſſion, and fallen from that where God had ſet him: but ſaith the Apoſtle, we ſee Jeſus who is made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of death, he is crowned with glory and honour that is everlaſting, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte of death for every man, which glory and honour changeth not, as the glory and honour of the firſt man did.</p>
               <p>So the glory of the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> he was made a living Soul, a little lower than the Angels, and all the glory of the firſt body he was crowned with, and had Dominion over all the viſible Creation, and had power over all the Creatures that God had made, God ſet him King over all the works of his hands, and gave him dominion and power over them; and here is the glory of the firſt man, and the glory of the firſt body, the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glory of the Creation, all things that God had made in the Heaven and in the Earth, and when he looked upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they were very good; <hi>Adam</hi> was crowned with the glory of them all, and had the Dominion over them, but this Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he loſt, and this glory he ſtained through his diſobedience and tranſgreſſion, and ſo fell, and became ſervant and in a ſtate of ſervitude, and not only ſo, but painful and miſerable with a ſentence upon him, that in the ſweat of his face he ſhould eat his bread. So after this, as hath been ſhewed, the Lord of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy confirmed his eternal love and Election of Grace in his promiſe unto his ſeed, and Covenant unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that of him he would bring forth a ſeed in whom all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed; which he hath faithfully and perfectly performed, as hath been ſhewed: And ſo he choſe a people from amongſt all the families of the earth, that he did owne for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as you may read <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. which he knew and had regard and love unto above all the families of the earth, as hath been ſhewed and manifeſted.</p>
               <p>Yet according as <hi>Adam</hi> did there rebell and tranſgreſs againſt him, though he had a continual care and an eye over them, and a continual regard unto them, and watched over them by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, as you may read in the Scriptures; for man was at
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52673:66"/>that time lower than the Angels. The Lord ſpake unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> by Angels, and unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Lord ſpake unto <hi>Moſes</hi> by his Angel, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2. and <hi>Acts</hi> 7.3. where <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith, And God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to be a Ruler and a Deliverer by the hand of the Angel which appeared to him in the Buſh. God alſo ſent his Ange unto <hi>David</hi> after he had numbred the people, as you may read 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. God ſent an Angel unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to deſtroy it, and when <hi>David</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ift up his eyes and ſaw the Angel of the Lord ſtand between the Earth and the Heaven, having a drawn ſword in his hand ſtretched over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then <hi>David</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> humbled themſelves, as you may read af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then the Lord commanded the Angel, and he put up his ſword into its ſheath.</p>
               <p>The Angel alſo was ſent unto <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> before the Birth of <hi>John,</hi> and unto <hi>Mary</hi> before the Birth of Chriſt, as you know; and the Angel came unto the Shepherds after the Birth of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.9. And the Angels came and miniſtred unto him, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.11. So the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by his Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. with many more that might be brought. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was warned of God by an Angel, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. and <hi>Stephen</hi> when he was bearing his teſtimony before the High-Prieſt, when he ſaid, Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in hearts and ears, which of the Prophets have not your Fathers perſecuted and ſlain? them which ſhewed before of the coming of the juſt one, of whom ye have been betrayers and murtherers, who have received the Law by the diſpoſition of Angels, and have not kept it, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.53. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. The Law was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator. So the Prophets and ſuch as the Lord made Overſeers and Leaders of his people, the Lord ſpoke to them by his Angels, and the Law they received by the Angels; but as the Apoſtle ſaith, in the fulneſs of time God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them that were under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3. for what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſent his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52673:67"/>us: read on in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. So they that walk after the Spirit, they are thoſe that fulfill the righteouſneſs of the Law; for the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus makes free from the Law of ſin and death, and this renews into the right and into the perfect Image, which is not lower than the Angels, but into the Image of the Son, unto which all the Angels are ſubject, according to the Apoſtles words <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>God who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds, who being the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory and the expreſs Image of his perſon, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins; for that was the work he was to do, when, as the Apoſtle ſaith, he became lower than the Angels for the ſuffering of death, and ſo took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and there he hath taſted death for every man, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to Bondage: and when he had finiſhed this work, he is ſet down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high, being made ſo much better than the Angels, as he hath by an inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they; for to which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, when he bringeth in his firſt begotten into the world, he ſaid, Let all the Angels worſhip him; and to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels he ſaith, Who hath made his Angels Spirits, and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters a flame of fire: but unto the Son he ſaith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever, a Scepter of Righteouſneſs is the Scepter of thy Kingdom: And ſo on.</p>
               <p>So here you may ſee, as the firſt man was made a little lower than the Angels, ſo the ſecond man the Lord from Heaven, the quickening ſpirit, is made higher than the Angels, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fathers glory, and his expreſs image.</p>
               <p>And ſo this is the ſeed, and body, and image which the Lord
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52673:67"/>God is raiſing and reſtoring and preparing to do his will, which far exceeds the glory of the firſt body; for the glory of the firſt body was a viſible glory, but the glory of the ſecond man, the ſecond body is an inviſible glory, and known and ſeen by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible eye, and manifeſted by the inviſible power and ſpirit of our Lord Jeſus, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins, who is the image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God, and the firſt born of every creature; by him were all things created, that are in Heaven and that are in Earth; viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible, whether they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities or Powers, all things were created by him and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt, and he is the Head of the Body, the Church, who is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the firſt begotten from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminency; and ſo this is he, and this is his Body and his Image which he is reſtoring and creating after God in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10.4.24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> by his ſaith ſaw him who is inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. who was the Father of the ſai hful, and ſo all the faithful who continue and abide in the faith of Gods Elect, will ſee the reſurrection and reſtauration of this inviſible body, which is the Church of Chriſt, the ſecond man, the Lord from Heaven; this is he who builds the ſecond houſe, who is a greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> and whoſe houſe far exceeds the glory of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorts his holy Brethren to conſider, the High Prieſt of our profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus, who was faithful to him that appointed him; as alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in all his houſe: for this man was counted worthy of more glory then <hi>Moſes,</hi> in as much as he who hath builded the houſe, hath more honour then the houſe; for every houſe is builded by ſome man; but he that buildeth all things is God: for <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in all his houſe as a ſervant; but Chriſt as a Son over his own houſe, whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the conſidence of the hope firm unto the end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and alſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. where the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> how to behave himſelf in the houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God, the ground and pillar of truth: ſo having therefore
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52673:68"/>boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt by a new and living way, and having an High-Prieſt over the Houſe of God, let us draw near with a true heart, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>So in this new and living way, Chriſt Jeſus, the light of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel, every one that abideth and walketh in this light, may enter by his blood into the holieſt of all; for he reigns over the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> according to the Angels words to <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1.32, 33.</p>
               <p>So the glory of this houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> is the Lord bringing forth and manifeſting, and will manifeſt every day more and more; and bleſſed and happy are all they that come into the brightneſs of the riſing of this glory, and as every one comes to the light of the Lord Jeſus, who is the image of the inviſible God, that ſhines in their hearts, will come more and more to ſee the glory of this day, and the glory and beauty of this body of Chriſt, which is his Church, and the glory and beauty of this image of the ſecond man, the Lord from Heaven, who is the brightneſs of his Fathers glory; and unto this King Eternal and Immortal, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and the only wiſe God, be Honour and Glory, for ever and ever.</p>
